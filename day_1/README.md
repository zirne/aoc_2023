Half the challenge consisted of getting to a state of "my program can read input params and read files based on those params", and trying to put that into a module located in a side by side directory relative to main. That was a hassle so I gave up and eventually reverted to putting everything in the same file. This is clearly not python where importing is about the easiest thing ever. Lots of googling and crap to solve both simple File I/O, handling of said input and regexing stuff.
